### About

The Legend of Jay Jay the Dragon is an intense tower defence game with an intricate and riveting plot line. 

### Story Background

Your father inherited the throne, then it was passed on to you after he passed. His brother—your uncle—was enraged because he did not get the throne. So, he slowly built his own opposing force in order to seize the throne. 

Soon after you rose to power, you adopted an orphaned dragon (Jay Jay) you found left at your castle door. This was the last straw for your uncle, as he felt that dragons were too powerful and threatened the safety of his newly-built kingdom. He decided to rally his forces and lay siege on your kingdom.

Now, you must defend your kingdom from your uncle’s forces, not only to protect the citizens and Jay Jay, but to restore balance to the world.
